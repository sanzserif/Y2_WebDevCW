        <h1>Musical instruments of Palladianism period</h1>
        <p>Throughout the 18th century, Palladianism was a fashionable architectural style in England. It was
            characterized by an emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and simplicity as well as a return to classical
            ideals. The classical style had an impact on musical instruments throughout this time period as well. During
            the Palladianism era, the following musical instruments were common:<br><br>
            <span id="para1">
                &#x2022; Fortepiano: A form of piano that gained popularity in the late 18th century was the fortepiano.
                It had a softer, more delicate sound and was smaller than a modern piano. The fortepiano was a favorite
                instrument of composers like Mozart and Beethoven and was frequently utilized in chamber music.<br><br>
            </span>
            <span id="para2">
                &#x2022; Harpsichord: A common keyboard instrument during the Palladianism era was the harpsichord. By
                using a quill or plectrum to pluck the strings, it had a distinctive tone. Baroque music frequently used
                the harpsichord, which was a favorite instrument of artists like Bach and Handel.<br><br>

            <span id="para3">

                favorite of composers like Vivaldi and Haydn and frequently employed in chamber music and orchestras. By
                bowing the strings, the violin could produce a unique sound.<br><br>
