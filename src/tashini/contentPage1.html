		<h1>Art Nouveau musical instruments</h1>
		<p>The late 19th-century art and design style known as Art Nouveau, commonly referred to as "New Art" or
			"Jugendstil," peaked in popularity around 1910. Several designers and painters were influenced by natural
			forms and patterns during this time, and there was a renewed fascination in craftsmanship and traditional
			methods.<br><br>

			Although Art Nouveau is frequently linked to architecture, furniture, and decorative arts, musical
			instruments were also influenced by it. During the Art Nouveau era, the following musical instruments were
			common:<br><br>


			<span id="para1">
				&#x2022; The Art Nouveau harp: The Art Nouveau harp is distinguished by its elaborate, sweeping lines
				and stylised floral motifs. It was frequently fashioned of wood and embellished with ivory or
				mother-of-pearl inlays.<br><br>
			</span>
			<span id="para2">
				&#x2022; Art Nouveau Guitar: The Art Nouveau guitar had a design with flowery designs and delicate,
				curved lines. The body was frequently built of wood, and mother-of-pearl or abalone inlays were used to
				embellish the fingerboard and headstock.<br><br>
			</span>
			<span id="para3">
				&#x2022; The Art Nouveau piano: The Art Nouveau piano was distinguished by its slender lines and
				ornamental components. The music stand had stylized floral motifs, and the legs and pedals frequently
				resembled flower stems.<br><br>
			</span>
			<span id="para4">
				&#x2022; Violin in the Art Nouveau style: This violin had curving lines and flowery decorations. The
				chinrest and tailpiece were ornamented, while the body was frequently made of wood.<br><br>
			</span>


			Overall, the design of musical instruments experienced a tremendous deal of ingenuity and innovation during
			the Art Nouveau era as artists and designers attempted to merge beauty and usefulness in novel and exciting
			ways.
