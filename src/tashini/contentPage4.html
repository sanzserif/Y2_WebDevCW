        <h1>Musical instruments of Modernism period</h1>
        <p>From the late 19th through the middle of the 20th century, the Modernism era saw a great deal of innovation
            and experimentation in music, art, and culture. In order to provide fresh and intriguing sounds, musical
            instruments were also changed and redesigned throughout this time. Throughout the Modernism era, the
            following musical instruments were common:<br><br>
            <span id="para1">

                popularity throughout the Modernism era. Jazz, classical music, and pop music were among the musical
                genres that utilized it. The saxophone is a versatile instrument with a distinctive sound produced by

                &#x2022; Electric guitar: The invention of the electric guitar at the turn of the 20th century
                completely altered the sound of popular music. It creates sound by amplifying electrical signals through
                a speaker from the vibrating of its strings. Rock, blues, jazz, and pop are just a few of the musical
                genres that have included the electric guitar.<br><br>

                virtually. The movement of the player's hands near two antennae is detected and turns into sound.

                that creates and manipulates electrical impulses to make sound. Rock, pop, and electronic music, among
                other styles of music, have all employed it. The synthesizer has been an important tool for developing
                fresh sounds, and it has been used to produce a wide range of sounds, from sweeping, beautiful
                soundscapes to loud, abrasive noise.<br><br>
