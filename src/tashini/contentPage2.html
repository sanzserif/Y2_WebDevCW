        <h1>Medieval Musical Instruments</h1>
        <p>The Christian Church's expansion, feudalism, and the advancement of European art, music, and culture were all
            features of the Medieval period, also known as the Middle Ages, which lasted from the 5th to the 15th
            century. Musical instruments played a significant role in both holy and popular music during this time.
            During the Middle Ages, the following musical instruments were common:<br><br>

            Gregorian Chant: A genre of music employed in the Catholic Church, Gregorian Chant is a variation of
            plainchant. It was sung by nuns and monks in cathedrals and monasteries all over Europe. The organ and the
            harp were the two instruments most frequently employed in Gregorian chant.<br><br>
            <span id="para1">
                &#x2022; Organistrum: Two people played the organistrum, a type of stringed instrument from the Middle
                Ages. It was akin to the hurdy-gurdy and featured a long neck with numerous strings. The organistrum was
                a common accompaniment instrument for liturgical music during the 12th and 13th centuries.<br><br>
            </span>
            <span id="para2">
                &#x2022; Psaltery: The strings of the psaltery were pluck-played stringed instruments. Throughout the
                Medieval Ages, it was widely utilized in holy music and enjoyed popularity across all of Europe.<br><br>
            </span>
            <span id="para3">
                &#x2022; Shawm: Similar to the oboe of today, the shawm was a form of medieval wind instrument. It was
                played by blowing air into its double reed. Both secular and spiritual music both frequently used the
                shawm.<br><br>
            </span>
            <span id="para4">
                &#x2022; Lute: A stringed instrument akin to the modern guitar, the lute was formerly popular. It has a
                long, fretted neck and a rounded body. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the lute was widely used in
                secular music.<br><br>
            </span>

            Overall, the Middle Ages were a time of remarkable invention in musical instrument design as artists and
            musicians worked to provide fresh and exciting sounds to go along with the music of the day. Many of the
            popular musical instruments from this era are still in use today.
